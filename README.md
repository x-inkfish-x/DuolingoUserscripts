# [Userscripts](#userscripts)

Just a few userscripts I made to test the capabilities of the DuolingoHelper that I made (also for my own enjoyment and because I find them useful). The scripts are even designed to work together! Hopefully this will encourage others to create useful userscripts!

I hope you'll find at least one that interests you. It's been a really interesting learning experience writing these, and I've personally found a lot of use for all of them. 

I'll do my best to maintain these in the future, but my hope is that they will work with minimal maintenance as long as DuolingoHelper is kept up to date. 

If you have any suggestions for how to improme my scripts, or some other scripts to add, please don't hesitate to give me a shout! (although, if you are a developer/curious about JavaScript, I would encourage you to write your own. If you want to use the DuolingoHelper, just head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/x-inkfish-x/DuolingoUserscripts/wiki) which will explain most of the class to you.)
